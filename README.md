# Wiki_Headings
In this particular repository we will be having two codes,
One code is a very basic code which is used just to scrap the title of an website and printing it.
While the other code is used for scrapping the headings from a wikipedia page using BeautifulSoup and printing all those headings on console.
These codes also explains each line by comments written after every line
